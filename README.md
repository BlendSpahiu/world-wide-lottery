## Create React App

This app was created with Create React App with integrated typescript. Using craco as a config override which I used mainly for pathname aliases for cleaner imports.

There are a few libraries I used in this project. What I used are:

- UseForm Hook for form handling https://react-hook-form.com/api/useform/
- TailwindCSS for faster styling https://tailwindcss.com/
- Joi for form validation https://joi.dev/
- React Router for declarative routing https://reactrouter.com/
- Material UI for out of the box ready components https://mui.com/
- CLSX for adding classnames on depending conditions https://github.com/lukeed/clsx
- SASS https://sass-lang.com/
- HeroIcons for cool icons https://heroicons.com/

This repo is public so just clone the repo via the link, run npm install and run the project using npm start.
